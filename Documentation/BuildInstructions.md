# Hydra Build Instructions
## Prerequisites
### Linux
There are no *prerequisites* as everything will be installed for you through a script. All that is required is that you are using any Debian-based distro.
### macOS
Again, there are no *prerequisites* to macOS.
## Windows
There is no official Windows support for Hydra Build Machine (HBM) at the moment. All you can do now is get a WSL version of Ubuntu, install QEMU on your machine and link them up. More info on this coming soon.
